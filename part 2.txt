-firstly we are creating a React application then import bootstrap css and javascript LINK
-then open terminal and download redux,react-redux and redux thunk library as following
      >>  npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk

-then create a navabar.js component as same as bootstrap document

-and create shop.js component as following

        import React from 'react'

        const Shop = () => {
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Deposite/Withdraw Money </h2>
            <button className="btn btn-primary mx-2">+</button>
            Update Balance
            <button className="btn btn-primary mx-2">-</button>
            </div>
        )
        }

        export default Shop

-and then clear App.js and import navabar.js and shop.js 

-then create a state folder and also make two folders inside state folders 1)action-creator and 2)reducers

    1)action-creator:- make index.js file and write following code..

                        export const depositeMoney = (amount) =>{
                            return (dispatch)=>{
                                dispatch({
                                type:'deposit',
                                payload:amount
                                })
                            }
                        }

                        export const withdrawMoney = (amount) =>{
                            return (dispatch)=>{
                                dispatch({
                                type:'withdraw',
                                payload:amount
                                })
                            }
                        }
    
    2)reducers:- make amountReducer.js and write following code..

                    export default reducer =  (state=0,action)=>{
                        if(action.type=='deposit'){
                            return state + action.payload
                        }
                        else if(action.type=='withdraw'){
                            return state - action.payload
                        }
                        else{
                            return state;
                        }
                    }
